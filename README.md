## Foreward / History

Thanks to the success of my first attempt to create Minimap for New World, I was overwhelmed by the support and feedback from the Discord community. You guys seemed to really enjoy the app and have made tons of suggestions. 
New World had a rough start and there were lots of comments on AGS forms talking about if tools like these should be allowed or not. In the end I believe as this tool is freely available and not giving anyone an unfair advantage and not violating any ToS. I decided to dust off my old lingering passion for New World and created my second Minimap filled with all your feature requests.

## Why a new application and not an update to the existing Minimap

New World Minimap is a small passion project developed in Unity right after New World’s Close Beta and since the Minimap’s creation I have learned a few new things and would like put them to practice. Rather than patching parts of the Code here and there, I decided to keep the existing Minimap update date with the latest New World Patches and Release, but secretly start a new Project “Aeternum Cartogram” with a clear goal insight.

## So.. wat’s NEW

The application is currently still in development and not all requested features are implemented yet, bet here are a few new things to expect.

-	Square Map: As simple as it may sounds this was one of the most requested features
-	Show Resource Routes on Minimap
-	Off-screen Map: many users requested to run the app on their second monitor, although there was a workaround for this, I wanted to do it right
-	Improved UI: for customization.
-	Windowed Mode
-	Rotate Minimap
-	Large Map: show/preview a larger area for the map to better plan your course
-	Support for GeForce Now
-	Support for Colour-blind Settings
-	Improved Position Screen capture accuracy and performance
-	Click and drag inside the Minimap: explore the area around you
-	Auto scale and zoom when entering settlements
-	New Resource Filter System: Only show what you want to see
-	Resources Timer: add a cooldown timer after harvesting a Node
-	Various Key-bindings for quick and easy access to all new features
-	Player trail: show where you have been
-	Theming: Make the Minimap personal.
-	Create a team/party session: share your location with you friends
-	and lots More…

## Setup

Just like the previous Minimap, “Aeternum Cartogram” also makes use of the in-game position coordinates that gets displayed by enabling the “Show FPS” settings in the games “Settings -> Visuals” section. 

- Step 1: Download and extract the latest version from the “Release” page.

- Step 2: Start New World and enable the “Show FPS” settings. {{picture}}

- Step 3: Start AeternumCartogram.exe. 

If the minimap does not automatically detect your position, open the Settings menu and navigate to the “Position” tab.  Click the “Automatic configure” button.
